Add your answers to the questions below.

1. What is the runtime complexity of your ring buffer's `append` method?
best case O(1) worst case O(n)

2. What is the space complexity of your ring buffer's `append` function?
n is st the list O(n)

3. What is the runtime complexity of your ring buffer's `get` method?
O(n) linear as the list needs to be rebuilt

4. What is the space complexity of your ring buffer's `get` method?
n is st the list O(n)


5. What is the runtime complexity of the provided code in `names.py`? 
nested  loops, O(n^2)

6. What is the space complexity of the provided code in `names.py`? 
 we are building lists, O(n)

7. What is the runtime complexity of your optimized code in `names.py`?
 O(1) as the best time is at = 0.003446 (closer to constant than I've eever seen my computer get before)

8. What is the space complexity of your optimized code in `names.py`?
O(n) because the space increased due to building a set
